# Jacob Nordan - Web Developer

This is my personal portfolio website, created to display all of my previous projects and skills to employers and anyone else who wants to check out my work!

## Technologies

To develop my portfolio website, I took advantage of React and Matieral UI to make a simplistic yet thought out approach on how I wanted my site to be setup.
